# React Portfolio Site

Clean, minimalist portfolio site with fluid UI and dynamic animations.   

Notable dependencies include:
* [material-ui](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui) - used for basic, styled components (text-field, tab navigator) based on Google's material design UI
* [popmotion](https://github.com/Popmotion/popmotion)/[react-posed](https://github.com/Popmotion/popmotion/tree/master/packages/react-pose) - used for state-based transitions and animations
* [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) - promise-based HTTP client used to retrieve and parse Medium JSON data
* [react-router-dom](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router) - declarative router for React; used with [react-router-transition](https://github.com/maisano/react-router-transition) for route transitions

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
